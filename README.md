Image classification using machine learning
This project aims to implement and compare different machine learning models for the
task of image classification. Student will work with a dataset of at least
500 images, organized into three or more classes (e.g., religious symbols, traffic signs,
leaf types, animals types). Each image should be resized to a fixed dimension (e.g.,
32×32 or 64×64) and flattened into a 1D feature vector for model input.
The models to be implemented are:
1. Naive Bayes Classifier – fast and effective for high-dimensional data like pixel values.
2. Decision Tree Classifier – interpretable and suitable for rule-based visual
classification.
3. Feedforward Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
The data set was get from open sourse called "kaggle"
